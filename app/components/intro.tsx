          ðŸš€ In sixth grade, I discovered Mr. Bill Gates, and in seventh grade, I encountered Mr. Mark Zuckerberg. These two individuals ignited my curiosity and sparked my interest in computer science. My journey began with a humble line of HTML code in seventh grade. As time went on, I delved into Java during eighth grade and explored C++ in eleventh grade, working on basic programs and projects along the way. Eventually, I chose Computer Science and Engineering as my career path.

           ðŸŽ¥ During my twelfth-grade year, a friend introduced me to the magic of camera angles and their impact on the awesomeness of a movie. This revelation led me to immerse myself in the world of exceptional acting, direction, music, and cinematic masterpieces.

          Throughout college, I continued coding extensively while indulging in countless movies.
